## My Setup

This repository contains my personal configuration files used for my programming environment. I like keeping things minimal but functional, so everything here is tuned for my comfort and productivity.

**ThinkPad T480**

My ThinkPad is still a beast. Even with an older CPU, this thing still absolutely cooks. It’s the last of its kind with PowerBridge dual-battery tech, giving me a solid 8–10 hours of life. I’m still obsessed with the classic black-and-red look, that world-class keyboard feel, and the matte screen that keeps glare at bay. They really don't make them like this anymore.

**Debian 13 (Trixie)**

As one of the oldest and most respected distributions, Debian is my top choice for its stability and minimal base. It grants me total control over my system, free from unnecessary bloat. On my machine, Debian delivers exceptional performance and battery efficiency, creating a distraction-free environment for development. As a bonus, I’ve always found the Toy Story naming convention incredibly charming.
