## My Setup

This repository contains my personal configuration files used for my web development environment. I like keeping things minimal but functional, so everything here is tuned for comfort and productivity.

### Machine: ThinkPad T480

A wonderful laptop that handles everything I need. I don’t really mind that it only has an 8th-gen CPU.  I haven’t even come close to pushing it to its limits. It’s reliable, solid, and I plan to stick with it for a long time.

### OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS

Why not use other distros like Arch or Fedora?

Because I genuinely enjoy Ubuntu’s out-of-the-box experience. Its customized GNOME setup just works for me and I’ve also removed Snap from my system (since its so slow lmao), so I only use Debian package and Flatpak for managing packages.

I’ve tried Debian and Fedora before, but honestly, I don’t have the time to tinker endlessly with configs. I just want to sit down, code, and get things done.

Lastly, because this has Long Term Support, I can use this workflow until 2027! How great is that!
