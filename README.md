## My Setup

This repository contains my personal configuration files used for my programming environment. I like keeping things minimal but functional, so everything here is tuned for my comfort and productivity.

### Snapshot

**Machine: ThinkPad T480**

- A versatile and reliable laptop that handles all my tasks effortlessly. Despite having an 8th Gen Intel CPU (2018), I’ve never come close to maxing it out.
- Features ThinkPad’s PowerBridge Technology with two internal batteries, allowing 8–10 hours of continuous work. I also plan to add a spare external battery for extended battery life.

**OS: Debian 13 Trixie**

- I like to be minimal with my setup.
